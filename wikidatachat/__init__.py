"""
This module serves as the entry point for the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline package. It imports and exposes the public interfaces and functionalities provided by the `.api` module, enabling users to interact with the RAG Pipeline's features seamlessly.

The RAG Pipeline integrates various components including document retrieval, question answering, and natural language understanding to augment the capabilities of traditional language models with external knowledge sources. This pipeline is particularly useful in scenarios where generating responses or answers requires pulling in context or information from a broad set of documents or data sources.

By importing everything from the `.api` module, this `__init__.py` file simplifies access to high-level functions, classes, and utilities necessary for setting up and running the RAG Pipeline. Users can leverage these interfaces to customize the pipeline's behavior, such as adjusting the document retrieval mechanisms, fine-tuning the response generation process, or integrating custom knowledge sources.

Example Usage:
--------------
```python
from rag_pipeline import your_function_here  # Replace `your_function_here` with actual functions or classes you wish to use.

# Set up your pipeline configurations and use the RAG functionalities as needed.
```

Please refer to the documentation of the `.api` module for detailed descriptions of the available interfaces and their respective usage guidelines.
